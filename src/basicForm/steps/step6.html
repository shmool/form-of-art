    To reduce digest cycles we use ngModelOptions, which is a directive that defines how the model updates are done.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>ngModelOptions receives an object which defines when the model should be updated.</li>
    <li>'updateOn' defines the triggers (events) for updating the model.</li>
    <li>'debounce' defines the time to wait when an update event is fired until the model is actually updated.
        If another event is caught during this time, the timer resets.</li>
    <li>'default' is the default update event of the control - on change.
        We set it to debounce for one second. (This is a high value, used for demonstration purpose.
        The standard is around 250 milliseconds.)</li>
    <li>When the input field is blurred, we would like the model to update immediately.
        So we give debounce value 0 to the 'blur' event.</li>
    <li>ngModelOptions affects all the nested models
        (putting it on a form element affects all the form's input models).
        You can override the behavior of the model in a specific element
        simply by giving it a new ngModelOptions object.</li>
</ul>

    We prevent the error messages to appear on load by giving a condition to show only when the form is dirty
    (the user has typed in one of the form's fields):
    <code>ng-messages="demo.myForm.$dirty && demo.myForm.$error"</code>
</p>

<p>
    <b>We still have a problem:</b> try entering values (either a valid or invalid email),
    changing them and submitting within a second. You will notice that the value submitted is the previous value,
    whether it's valid (then it is shown in the alert) or not (the submit function isn't fired).
    This is because of the debounce we have set: the new value of the model is not committed yet.
