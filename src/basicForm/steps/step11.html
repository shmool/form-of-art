<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>There are few thing you can try on your own at this stage:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use css classes (Bootstrap's and/or your own) to design the form and the error messages.
        You may need to use ngClass. For example, put
        <code>ng-class="{'alert alert-danger' : demo.myForm.$invalid}"</code> on the ngMessages element.</li>
    <li>Explore the form and the control attributes.</li>
    <li>Add more controls and error messages to the form.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the following session we will stay in the ng neighbourhood, where we will explore:</p>
<ul>
    <li>custom validation</li>
    <li>more options in ngMessages</li>
    <li>ng-disabled and its problems</li>
</ul>

<p>The <b>Form of Art</b> series will later continue with advanced issues,
    including various input types, nested forms, async validation and third-party libraries. Stay tuned!</p>
